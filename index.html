        <p>Unlike water that lets you float and flow — if you know how to swim — mountains make you work your way up.
            When they say it s a climb, they really mean it s a task and a tussle. Youre panting and fighting for your
            breath, while feeling incredulously excited about reaching the top. And unless you re an experienced
            trekker, hiker or a mountaineer, you re faced by an invulnerable, immovable object. I personally, am a beach
            person. I love water in all its forms — beaches, lakes, rivers, waterfalls…you name any water source and I
            love it. Yes, even showers and bathtubs. It’s calming. It’s welcoming.</p>

            prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other
            breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of
            justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might
            lead to a breach of the peace;</p>
